# Network Programming and Middleware Technologies

This repository contains projects and implementations related to network programming and middleware technologies, focusing on scalable and distributed solutions. The main topics covered include:  

- **Network programming in Python**: Use of TCP and UDP sockets, connection management, client-server protocols, and advanced interprocess communication techniques.  
- **gRPC**: Development of high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services with support for load balancing, authentication, and bidirectional streaming.  
- **Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)**: Implementation of asynchronous messaging systems using message queues and brokers like ActiveMQ to ensure reliability and scalability.  
- **Communication protocols**: Exploration of standard protocols such as HTTP/2 and WebSockets for distributed applications.  
- **Security in network communications**: Techniques for encryption, authentication, and data protection in distributed environments.  
- **Practical exercises and projects**: Real-world implementations to test and deepen the concepts covered.
